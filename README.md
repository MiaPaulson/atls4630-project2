# atls4630-project2
Final Project for FrontEnd Web Development

## Milestone 1 - Project Proposal
I will be working alone for this project.

I want this project to just be fun and creative! I am hoping to have it be multiple little mini games: card memory game, hangman, and rock-paper-scissors, and more if I can think of some. I have played one of those silly little card memory game with my younger cousin recently, and I figured it would be fun to make a cute project out of it! I want my project to be centerd on fun and simple "mini" games that you can play with your friends or solo! My intended audience is anyone needing a quick game break from homework, kids who need some brain stimulation, or someone just looking to kill some time with something fun that isn't as brain-rotty as social media.

My basic wireframes are:

My goals for each section of the project are:
1. By Milestone 2 I will have the high fidently prototypes and static versions of all three games.
2. By Milestone 3 I will have three fun, cute little games that are working completely for users to use.
3. Some stretch goals I have are: having more than three games for users to choose from (other options are things like maybe sudoku, a type of wordle game, etc), having timers on all the games so that users can create some competition aspects with their friends, and possibly having profiles for users to keep track of their times/past games they've played.


I am excited to do a more creative, game-centerd project! :)


## Milestone 2 - Static Version
For this static version I figured out how to use Next.js for the first time! Having all of the pages link in to the home and creating a navigation bar was not too crazy, and I enjoyed the extra practice with CSS to bring together the overall look of my app. I want it to be silly and playful, so I used pastel colors and the "cursive" font since it looks more hand-written and super fun for people to use.

My home page does not have an UI components, since they are all links in the nav bar and buttons linking to the other pages.
