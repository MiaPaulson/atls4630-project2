# atls4630-project2
Final Project for FrontEnd Web Development

## Milestone 1 - Project Proposal
I will be working alone for this project.

I want this project to just be fun and creative! I am hoping to have it be multiple little mini games: card memory game, hangman, and rock-paper-scissors, and more if I can think of some. I have played one of those silly little card memory game with my younger cousin recently, and I figured it would be fun to make a cute project out of it! I want my project to be centerd on fun and simple "mini" games that you can play with your friends or solo! My intended audience is anyone needing a quick game break from homework, kids who need some brain stimulation, or someone just looking to kill some time with something fun that isn't as brain-rotty as social media.

My basic wireframes are:

My goals for each section of the project are:
1. By Milestone 2 I will have the high fidently prototypes and static versions of all three games.
2. By Milestone 3 I will have three fun, cute little games that are working completely for users to use.
3. Some stretch goals I have are: having more than three games for users to choose from (other options are things like maybe sudoku, a type of wordle game, etc), having timers on all the games so that users can create some competition aspects with their friends, and possibly having profiles for users to keep track of their times/past games they've played.


I am excited to do a more creative, game-centered project! :)


## Milestone 2 - Static Version
For this static version I figured out how to use Next.js for the first time! Through the lecture on Next.js, reading through the documentation, and asking ChatGPT syntax-specific questions I have built this multi-page static version. Having all of the pages link in to the home and creating a navigation bar was not too crazy, and I enjoyed the extra practice with CSS to bring together the overall look of my app. I want it to be silly and playful, so I used pastel colors and the "cursive" font since it looks more hand-written and super fun for people to use.

I have successfully achieved my goal of finishing the high fidelity (with a fun design!), static version of all three games. The pages are also all connected with the nav bar, making going through all of the pages seamless.

My home page (above) does not have an UI components, since they are all links in the nav bar and buttons linking to the other pages.

## Milestone 3 - Minimum Viable Product

This project was super fun to make! I liked that I could be silly but still make a finished product that I am proud of.

My biggest hiccup across the whole project was React's re-rendering process. Every time I was about to explode because something was going wrong I went to my good friend (much needed at some points throughout this project) ChatGPT and it very nicely let me know that it was the same issue every time. I will say, every time I was stuck and used ChatGPT, I made sure to learn my code more and figure out what was going on instead of just copy and pasting. I am very glad we got to use it as a tool!

I may take hours and hours to code something another person could in less than half the time, but I am proud of my progress throughout this class! I always say: "I love to code... when it works!... and it never works..." But I really did enjoy working on this project, it was super fun!


## Milestone 4 - Reflection

My creative approach was really just leaning into the fun and silly. Everything is always so serious all the time, and having the "child-like" qualities of fun games was really my main inspriation for these games! I was unable to acheive my stretch goals of timers for the memory game and tallies for the rock, paper, scissors game, but I am still very proud of myself for creating these mini games! Even if they are not the most competitive (that would come with the stretch goals) they are fun, and they work great.

Learning Next.js came with its quirks, but it was not too crazy. A lot of trial and error, but the lecture in class helped because it was not entirely foreign. Sometimes with coding projects I feel like I have to relearn the coding language and logic every time I sit down to do it, but once I got this project started it wasn't too bad to keep it rolling!

Doing silly CSS was super fun since I got to use the crazy not-so-accepted colors and a more goofy font. As a UI/UX desinger, working to design something that is not sleek and modern like what most people are lookng for these days took me out of my common design practices, but allowed me to have fun with the process and create something unique.
